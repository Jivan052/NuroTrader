# NeuroTrader Quick Start Guide

This guide will help you get up and running with NeuroTrader quickly. Follow these simple steps to start exploring cryptocurrency analytics and interacting with the AI agent.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js 16+ or Bun

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jivan052/NeuroTrader.git

You'll need to obtain an API key from [AgentKit](https://agentkit.dev) or use your OpenAI API key.

## Running the Application

```bash
npm run agent
```
